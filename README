FotoIPCam...

is a little Android App, which listens for HTTP Connections on Port 8080. If a client connects, it takes a picture with the Phone's camera and sends the result as JPEG to the requesting client.

This App was created as Prototype for the VisiCut Tool. See http://hci.rwth-aachen.de/visicut for more information.
